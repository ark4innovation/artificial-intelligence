## TV Script Generation
TV Script Generation
This project was done as part of my Udacity Deep-Learning Nanodegree. In this project, I generated my own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I used part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network generated a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
