# My Data Science Portfolio
Adventures in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning

## Face Generation
[github](https://github.com/ark4innovation/datascience/tree/master/deep-learning/udacity-projects/face-generation), [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ark4innovation/datascience/blob/master/deep-learning/udacity-projects/face-generation/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb)

This project was done as part of my Udacity Deep-Learning Nanodegree. In this project, I built a generative adversarial network and trained it on CelebA dataset in order to generate new images of faces.

## Language Translation
[github](https://github.com/ark4innovation/datascience/tree/master/deep-learning/udacity-projects/language-translation), [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ark4innovation/datascience/blob/master/deep-learning/udacity-projects/language-translation/dlnd_language_translation.ipynb)

This project was done as part of my Udacity Deep-Learning Nanodegree. In this project, I built trained a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences in order to translate new sentences from English to French.

## TV Script Generation
[github](https://github.com/ark4innovation/datascience/blob/master/deep-learning/udacity-projects/tv-script-generation), [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ark4innovation/datascience/blob/master/deep-learning/udacity-projects/tv-script-generation/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb)

This project was done as part of my Udacity Deep-Learning Nanodegree. In this project, I generated my own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I used part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network generated a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

## Image Classification

This project was done as part of my Udacity Deep-Learning Nanodegree. In this project, I classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consisted of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. I preprocessed the images, then trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images were normalized and the labels one-hot encoded. Then I built neurl network with convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers to predict on sample images.
